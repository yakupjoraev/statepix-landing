            <p class="security__item-descr">Our servers are protected by state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems
              (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that actively monitor traffic and block suspicious activity.
              In addition, we use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to protect against SQL injections and XSS, ensuring
              reliable protection of user data.</p>

              algorithms that generate temporary codes that are only available on user devices, making unauthorized
